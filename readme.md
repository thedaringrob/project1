#Unit 1 Project
___
##Approach

Set out to make a sophisticated turn based fighting game, utilizing
Javascript, CSS, and HTML building on the initial homework 
assignment.

##Psuedo Code
I did psuedo code and wire framing on paper.  Let me know if you need to see them.

##Problems Faced
I wanted to make this project with no outside help to really test
what I've learned since the class started.  Javascript has been 
very difficult for me to figure out.

Took me 2 days to get the logic working and I did need to ask for help.
Turns out I was trying to do both Javascript and JQuery at the same time.
Once I cleared that up I was able to make a workable product.

1. Was not able to manipulate images to animate. Huge Fail.
2. Could not figure out how to make the game run 3 times before 
declaring winner.  Tried to wrap entire game inside another 
function that was tied to a counter but this broke the code.
3. Button toggles are a bit iffy.  Some are commented out that broke code.
Couldn't figure out why it broke code.

##Overall
Looking at the project overall I would say this is a bronze level
product.  It is functional to an extent and runs a complete game. 
It does not contain products and effects that I set out to include, 
which really bums me out.

My personal victory: I was able to create something (from conception to delivery) 
that 2 weeks ago would not have been possible.
